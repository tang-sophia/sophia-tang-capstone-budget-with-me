# Project Title

Budget with me

## Overview

What is your app? Give a brief description in a couple of sentences.

Budget with Me is an intuitive personal finance app designed to help users track their income and expenses. The app allows users to set budgets, monitor financial progress, and gain real-time insights into their financial health. The interactive dashboard provides users with a clear and visual overview of their financial situation, helping them make informed decisions about their money.

### Problem Space

Why is your app needed? Give any background information around any pain points or other reasons.

Managing personal finances is often challenging due to the use of multiple tools like spreadsheets, apps, or manual tracking methods. This fragmented approach can be overwhelming and inefficient. Budget with Me solves this by consolidating all financial information into a single, user-friendly app, providing users with a streamlined and efficient way to manage their finances.

- Individuals with different financial goals, like saving for a home, building an emergency fund, or investing in the stock market.
- Basically, anyone looking to take control of their finances.

How They'll Use It:

- Users will create an account and input their financial data (income, expenses)
- Users can view a financial summary on their dashboard and access detailed reports on spending

Special Considerations:

- The app will be user-friendly, with simple navigation and accessible financial explanations for users of varying financial knowledge.
- Mobile-responsive to ensure ease of use across devices.
